# 2026-07-10 windows_native_support

## Goal and acceptance criteria

- [x] Windows 10/11 can build, run, and install without WSL, Git Bash, or Unix-only collector dependencies.
- [x] Drive-letter, UNC, spaces, Unicode, and common profile path prefixes are handled through native path APIs.
- [x] Windows defaults use `%LOCALAPPDATA%` for app data and `%USERPROFILE%`-relative assistant directories.
- [x] Existing Windows databases and separator-specific sync state remain migration-compatible.
- [x] Antigravity and Copilot have native PowerShell collectors with the existing JSONL/delta contract.
- [ ] Verification commands pass and observed results are recorded in the final verification story.

## Plan

- [x] Locate authoritative path, migration, resource, installer, release, collector, API, and UI code.
- [x] Design the smallest cross-platform path/resource layer and backward-compatible migrations.
- [x] Implement backend, installer, collector, setup UI, release CI, and documentation changes.
- [x] Add Rust regression tests and a PowerShell collector smoke test.
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`, `cargo build --release`, and `scripts/test-windows.ps1`.
- [ ] Run an installed-release HTTP smoke test from a different working directory.

## Risk and rollback

- Risk: medium.
- Affected components: path resolution, SQLite startup migration, resource discovery, setup API/UI, Windows release installation, status-line collection.
- Rollback: revert this change set. Database relocation deletes the source only after copy length verification and destination sync; a failed relocation preserves the source.
- Monitoring signals: startup database-path diagnostics, sync errors, setup-info paths, Windows CI collector/install/API smoke tests.

## Dependencies and environment

- Rust stable with the MSVC toolchain on Windows.
- Visual Studio Build Tools C++ workload for native compilation.
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or newer for installer and collectors.
- No new Rust or JavaScript dependencies.

## Working notes

- Persisted sync-state keys use `/` even on Windows; migrations recognize historical `/` and `\` values.
- Assistant directory overrides are authoritative even before the directory exists.
- `INSIGHTS_DIR` is created by `get_db_conn`; Windows defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TokenUsageInsights`.
- Release resources are resolved relative to the executable/project rather than only the process CWD.
- SQLite on UNC paths is parsed correctly but local-disk storage is recommended because SMB locking varies.

## Results

- Added shared native path/resource handling, Windows-safe database migration, PowerShell collectors, installer hardening, native setup commands, and Windows release smoke coverage.
- Verification evidence is the remaining checkpoint and will be reported command-by-command after execution.

# 2026-07-10 codex_session_count_mismatch

## Goal and acceptance criteria

- [x] Explain, with code and local-data evidence, why the Codex daily metric shows 8 sessions while the session table shows 3.
- [x] Identify the exact counting/filtering rule used by each UI surface.
- [x] Provide a deterministic verification query or command; do not change product behavior without explicit approval.

## Plan

- [x] Define the target flow and identify the two rendered counts.
- [x] Trace both counts through frontend state, API handlers, and SQL aggregation.
- [x] Correlate the 2026-07-10 local Codex files and database rows without exposing transcript content.
- [x] Verify the root cause independently and record results.

## Risk and rollback

- Risk: low; read-only diagnosis.
- Affected components: Codex daily summary and session-list reporting only.
- Rollback: not applicable unless a later fix is requested.

## Working notes

- Target flow: select Codex and 2026/07/10 -> compare the left total-session metric with the right session-table badge and rows.
- The API constructs `summary.total_sessions` and `sessions` from the same session map, so their raw cardinality is identical.
- The frontend table first converts `sessions` into a parent/child forest and counts only the flattened, root-reachable result.
- Codex subagent metadata consistently uses `id` for the rollout UUID and `session_id`/`parent_thread_id` for the parent thread; the parser currently prefers `session_id` over `id`.
- Browser-plugin invocation was blocked because the runtime request lacked required sandbox metadata; localhost API and database checks provided the deterministic repro instead.

## Results

- Reproduced the screenshot state: API summary/raw list contained 8 sessions; 5 had `parent_session_id == session_id`, so the frontend forest retained only 3 roots.
- Audited 45 Codex JSONL rollout files for the date. Across 36 subagent metadata rows, `id` matched the file UUID 36/36, while `session_id` matched `parent_thread_id` 36/36.
- Parser field precedence collapses subagent rollout IDs into their parent ID. Per-file sync then deletes existing rows for that shared ID before inserting the current file, so sibling/parent data can replace one another.
- No product code was changed. Verification used the live daily API, redacted metadata-field correlation, and independent backend/frontend/data audits.

# 2026-07-10 fix_codex_session_identity

## Goal and acceptance criteria

- [x] Codex subagent rollouts use their own metadata `id` while retaining `parent_thread_id` as the parent relation.
- [x] Existing collapsed Codex database rows are removed and all JSONL files are deterministically reparsed once.
- [x] The daily table preserves every unique API session even when legacy or malformed parent links contain self/cyclic references.
- [x] Regression tests fail on the old behavior and pass after the fix.
- [x] For 2026-07-10, the daily summary count, raw API session count, and rendered table count agree.

## Plan

- [x] Checkpoint A: capture failing parser/tree behavior and locate migration/test patterns.
- [x] Checkpoint B: implement parser identity precedence, rebuild migration, and frontend cycle guards.
- [x] Checkpoint C: add regression coverage and run targeted/full verification.
- [x] Checkpoint D: verify the live API/UI outcome and document results.

## Risk and rollback

- Risk: medium; this changes Codex session identity and rebuilds derived local database rows.
- Affected components: Codex JSONL parsing, Codex sync state, derived `usage_entries`, and daily session-tree rendering.
- Source safety: files under `CODEX_DIR` remain read-only; only derived SQLite rows and sync markers are rebuilt.
- Rollback: revert the parser/UI changes and migration marker. The original Codex JSONL files remain the source of truth and can be reparsed.
- Monitoring signals: Codex sync errors, distinct transcript/session counts, self-parent count, and daily summary/table cardinality.

## Dependencies and environment

- No new dependencies.
- Active localhost service may need restart before the new parser migration executes.

## Working notes

- Current sample invariant: subagent `payload.id` matches rollout filename UUID; `payload.session_id`, `forked_from_id`, and `parent_thread_id` identify the parent.
- Subagent rollouts contain a second embedded parent `session_meta`; canonical identity is locked from the first valid metadata event while later events may still enrich non-identity fields.
- Empty/token-less reparses preserve existing rows and do not advance file state; current sources are reconciled by transcript path and canonical session ID.
- Final migration marker is `migration:codex_session_identity_v6` because earlier v4/v5 attempts may have partially executed during live readiness testing.

## Results

- Parser and sync now retain distinct parent/child rollout identities, preserve legacy data safely during empty parses, and rekey Windows path variants without touching source JSONL or unrelated assistants.
- Frontend tree flattening emits every unique session once for valid, self-parent, and cyclic graphs; identifier lookup and HTML interpolation are hardened.
- Regression proof: the two-metadata parser fixture failed before the identity lock and passed afterward; `cargo test` passed 12/12, `cargo fmt -- --check` passed, and Clippy passed for all targets/features.
- Frontend deterministic assertions passed 12/12 across normal trees, self/cycles, duplicate IDs, prototype-key IDs, and escaped rendering.
- Live 2026-07-10 result changed from 9 sessions / 5 self-parent / 9 retained transcripts / 936 rows to 45 / 0 / 45 / 3905; 36 sessions retain valid parents and no parent is missing.
- Live cardinality is `summary=45`, `raw=45`, and `frontend-flat=45`, with zero duplicate flat rows.
- HTTP smoke passed: `/` and `/static/app.js` returned 200, the dashboard shell/title rendered in source, and the served script contains the cycle and identifier-safety fixes.
- Browser-plugin validation was blocked by missing sandbox metadata in the browser runtime; no external-browser fallback was used.
- Pre-migration DB/old binaries and startup logs are retained under `%TEMP%\token-usage-insights-pre-codex-v4-20260710-204706` for rollback.
